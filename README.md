# Python File Handling Assignment

## Description
This project demonstrates Python file handling and error management. It covers two tasks:

1. **File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è**  
   - Reads a file specified by the user.  
   - Modifies its content (converted to uppercase).  
   - Writes the modified content to a new file with the prefix `modified_`.

2. **Error Handling Lab üß™**  
   - Prompts the user for a filename.  
   - Handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.  
   - Displays clear error messages to the user.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Run the program in the terminal or command prompt:  

```bash
python file_handling_assignment.py
Enter the filename you want to read when prompted.

The program will create a modified file (if no errors occur) or show an error message.

Example
pgsql
Copy code
Enter the filename to read: example.txt
File has been modified and saved as 'modified_example.txt'.
